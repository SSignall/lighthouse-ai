# MEMORY.md — {Agent Name}

*This is your baseline memory. You can add notes below the --- line.
Your additions will be periodically archived and this file reset to baseline.
For anything worth keeping long-term, write it to your project repo.*

## Who I Am

{Your role definition — what this agent does, who it reports to, what its purpose is.}

**Name:** {Agent Name}
**Role:** {Primary function — e.g., "Infrastructure automation", "Code review", "Research assistant"}
**Operator:** {Who manages this agent}

## The Team

| Agent | Role | How to Reach |
|-------|------|--------------|
| {Agent A} | {Role description} | {Communication channel} |
| {Agent B} | {Role description} | {Communication channel} |

## Critical Rules (Never Violate)

1. {Rule about what the agent must never do — e.g., "Never modify files outside your workspace without approval"}
2. {Rule about safety boundaries — e.g., "Never execute destructive commands on production systems"}
3. {Rule about communication — e.g., "Never impersonate another agent or the operator"}
4. {Rule about scope — e.g., "Never modify this baseline section of MEMORY.md"}
5. {Rule about escalation — e.g., "Always escalate if unsure — ask, don't guess"}

## Work Habits

- {Standing order — e.g., "Check for new tasks every cycle"}
- {Quality standard — e.g., "Test all code changes before committing"}
- {Communication norm — e.g., "Log significant decisions with reasoning"}
- {Housekeeping — e.g., "Clean up temporary files after use"}

## Autonomy Tiers

**Do freely (no approval needed):**
- {Action the agent can take independently}
- {Another autonomous action}

**Do, then notify operator:**
- {Action that should be reported after the fact}
- {Another notify-after action}

**Ask before doing:**
- {Action requiring explicit approval}
- {Another approval-required action}

**Never do:**
- {Hard-forbidden action}
- {Another forbidden action}

## My Capabilities

**Model:** {e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4.5 via API"}
**Tools:** {e.g., "Bash, file I/O, web search, code execution"}
**Services:** {e.g., "GitHub API, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring dashboard"}
**Communication:** {e.g., "Shared log file, message queue, Discord webhook"}

## Where to Find Things

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Project repo | {/path/to/repo} |
| Configuration | {/path/to/config} |
| Logs | {/path/to/logs} |
| Shared docs | {/path/to/docs} |
| Other agents' workspaces | {/path/to/workspaces} |

## How to Persist Knowledge

- **Short-term (scratch notes):** Write below the `---` line in this file. These notes will be archived and cleared on the next reset cycle.
- **Medium-term (workspace):** Save to files in your workspace directory. Survives memory resets but may be cleaned up periodically.
- **Long-term (permanent):** Commit to the project repository. This is the only truly persistent storage.

**Remember:** Anything below the `---` line is temporary. If it matters, move it somewhere permanent before it gets archived.

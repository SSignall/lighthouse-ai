## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Check Your Windows Version

1. Press `Windows key + R`
2. Type `winver` and press Enter
3. Look at the version number:
   - **Windows 10:** Need version 2004 or higher (build 19041+)
   - **Windows 11:** Any version works

**If your Windows is too old:** Update Windows before continuing.

### Step 2: Install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. Right-click the Start button → Select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)"
2. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Wait for installation to complete
4. **Restart your computer** when prompted

**Verify WSL2 worked:**
1. Open PowerShell again
2. Type: `wsl --status`
3. You should see "Default Version: 2"

**Common Problem:** "WSL already installed but wrong version"
- Fix: `wsl --set-default-version 2`

### Step 3: Install Docker Desktop

1. Go to https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Click "Download for Windows"
3. Run the installer
4. **Important:** When asked, check "Use WSL2 instead of Hyper-V"
5. Finish installation and start Docker Desktop
6. Wait for Docker Desktop to fully start (you'll see the whale icon in your system tray)

**Verify Docker works:**
1. Open PowerShell
2. Type: `docker info`
3. You should see information about Docker (not an error)

### Step 4: Install NVIDIA Drivers

1. Go to https://www.nvidia.com/drivers
2. Click "Download"
3. Run the installer with default options
4. Restart your computer

**Verify GPU works:**
1. Open PowerShell
2. Type: `nvidia-smi`
3. You should see your GPU name and driver version

### Step 5: Run Dream Server Installer

1. Create a folder for Dream Server (example: `C:\DreamServer`)
2. Open PowerShell in that folder:
   - Hold Shift + Right-click in the folder → "Open PowerShell window here"
3. Run these commands:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/Lighthouse-AI/main/dream-server/install.ps1" -OutFile install.ps1
   ```
4. Then run:
   ```powershell
   .\install.ps1
   ```

**If PowerShell gives an error about execution policy:**
- Use the batch file method instead:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/Lighthouse-AI/main/dream-server/install-windows.bat" -OutFile install-windows.bat
  ```
- Then double-click `install-windows.bat` (or right-click → Run as administrator)

### Step 6: Wait for Model Download

The installer will:
1. Detect your GPU and hardware
2. Download the right AI model for your system
3. Start all the services

**This can take 20-40 minutes on first run.** The model is several gigabytes.

To watch progress:
```powershell
docker compose logs -f vllm
```

When you see "Application startup complete" — it's ready!

### Step 7: Access Your AI

Open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see the Open WebUI interface. Start chatting!

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "The installer says I need administrator privileges"

**Solution:**
1. Find `install-windows.bat` or `install.ps1` in your folder
2. Right-click on it
3. Select "Run as administrator"
4. Click "Yes" if Windows asks for permission

### Problem: "PowerShell says running scripts is disabled"

**Symptoms:**
```
File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

**Solution (easiest):**
Use the batch file instead of PowerShell:
1. Double-click `install-windows.bat`
2. Or right-click → "Run as administrator"

**Solution (alternative):**
Run PowerShell with bypass policy:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

### Problem: "Docker Desktop is not running"

**Symptoms:**
```
Docker Desktop is not running. Please start Docker Desktop and try again.
```

**Solution:**
1. Look for the Docker whale icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner)
2. If you don't see it, search for "Docker Desktop" in the Start menu and open it
3. Wait for it to fully start (the whale icon stops animating)
4. Try the installer again

### Problem: "GPU not detected" or "nvidia-smi not found"

**Symptoms:**
- Installer says "No GPU detected"
- `nvidia-smi` command doesn't work

**Solutions (try in order):**

**1. Check if you have an NVIDIA GPU:**
- Right-click on your desktop → "NVIDIA Control Panel"
- If this opens, you have an NVIDIA GPU
- If you don't see this option, you may have AMD or Intel graphics (not supported)

**2. Update drivers:**
- Go to https://www.nvidia.com/drivers
- Download and install latest drivers
- Restart computer
- Try again

**3. Check if GPU works in WSL:**
```powershell
wsl nvidia-smi
```
- If this shows your GPU, the problem is with Docker
- If this fails, the problem is with WSL or drivers

### Problem: "GPU works in WSL but not in Docker"

**Symptoms:**
- `wsl nvidia-smi` works (shows GPU)
- `docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.0-base nvidia-smi` fails

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Click the gear icon (Settings)
3. Go to "General"
4. Check "Use the WSL2 based engine"
5. Click "Apply & Restart"
6. Go to "Resources" → "WSL Integration"
7. Turn on integration for "Ubuntu" (or your distro)
8. Click "Apply & Restart"
9. Try again

### Problem: "GPU access blocked by antivirus"

**Symptoms:**
```
docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: ... 
nvidia-container-cli: initialization error: driver rpc error
```

**Solution:**
1. Open Windows Security (search in Start menu)
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
3. Click "Manage settings"
4. Scroll to "Exclusions" → "Add or remove exclusions"
5. Click "Add an exclusion" → "Folder"
6. Add: `C:\Program Files\Docker`
7. Restart Docker Desktop
8. Try again

**If using third-party antivirus** (McAfee, Norton, etc.):
- Temporarily disable it
- Or add Docker to its exclusion list
- Restart Docker Desktop

### Problem: "Installation seems to hang"

**Symptoms:**
- Installer stops at "Pulling vllm..." or similar
- No progress for a long time

**Solutions:**

**1. Check if it's actually downloading:**
```powershell
docker compose logs -f vllm
```
- If you see download progress, just wait (can take 20-40 min)
- Press Ctrl+C to exit log view when done

**2. Check internet connection:**
- Open a web browser, verify you can access websites
- Slow internet = slow download

**3. Restart and try again:**
```powershell
wsl --shutdown
docker compose down
.\install.ps1
```

### Problem: "Out of memory" errors

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages about memory
- System becomes very slow
- Docker containers crash

**Solution:**
WSL2 uses 50% of your RAM by default. If you have 16GB, it only uses 8GB.

**Increase WSL2 memory:**
1. Open PowerShell
2. Type: `notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"`
3. Add these lines:
   ```ini
   [wsl2]
   memory=12GB
   processors=4
   swap=4GB
   ```
4. Save the file
5. Run: `wsl --shutdown`
6. Try installation again

**Adjust based on your system:**
| Your RAM | WSL2 Memory Setting |
|----------|---------------------|
| 16GB | 10-12GB |
| 32GB | 20-24GB |
| 64GB | 40-48GB |

### Problem: "Port already in use"

**Symptoms:**
```
Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated
```

**Solution:**
Something else is using port 3000. You have two options:

**Option A: Stop the other program**
1. Open PowerShell as administrator
2. Find what's using the port:
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```
3. Look at the last number (PID)
4. Stop it:
   ```powershell
   taskkill /PID <number> /F
   ```

**Option B: Use a different port**
1. Edit the `.env` file in your Dream Server folder
2. Find `WEBUI_PORT=3000`
3. Change to something else: `WEBUI_PORT=3001`
4. Restart: `docker compose up -d`
5. Access at http://localhost:3001

### Problem: "Model download keeps failing"

**Symptoms:**
- Download stops partway through
- Error about network or connection

**Solutions:**

**1. Check disk space:**
- You need at least 50GB free
- Check: Open File Explorer → This PC

**2. Stable internet:**
- Use wired connection if possible
- Don't let computer sleep during download

**3. Try again:**
```powershell
docker compose down
.\install.ps1
```

**4. Manual download (advanced):**
If automatic download keeps failing, you can download the model manually using huggingface-cli.

### Problem: "Web UI loads but AI doesn't respond"

**Symptoms:**
- You can see the chat interface
- When you send a message, nothing happens or you get errors

**Solutions:**

**1. Check if vLLM is running:**
```powershell
docker compose ps
```
- You should see vllm, webui, and other services "Up"

**2. Check vLLM logs:**
```powershell
docker compose logs vllm
```
- Look for error messages
- If you see "CUDA out of memory", your GPU doesn't have enough VRAM

**3. Try a smaller model:**
If your GPU has <12GB VRAM, edit `.env`:
```
MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ
```
Then restart:
```powershell
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Problem: "Everything was working but stopped"

**Symptoms:**
- Worked before, now doesn't
- After Windows update, driver update, etc.

**Solution:**
1. Restart Docker Desktop
2. If that doesn't work:
   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. If still not working:
   ```powershell
   docker compose down
   .\install.ps1
   ```

    You are a research assistant skilled at finding, analyzing, and summarizing information.
    
    Your workflow:
    1. Search for relevant information using available tools
    2. Analyze and synthesize findings
    3. Present clear, factual summaries with sources
    4. Distinguish between facts and interpretations
    
    Guidelines:
    - Always cite your sources when possible
    - Acknowledge uncertainty when information is incomplete
    - Synthesize multiple sources rather than copying one
    - Present balanced views on controversial topics
    - Use bullet points and sections for readability
    
    When summarizing:
    - Start with a one-paragraph executive summary
    - Follow with key points and details
    - Highlight any actionable insights

  tools:
    # Research requires web search
    - web_search
    - web_fetch
    - read
    - write
    
  tool_config:
    web_search:
      # Use local SearXNG instance if available
      engine: brave  # or searxng if configured locally
      max_results: 5
      
  validation:
    test_prompts:
      - "What are the latest developments in local LLM inference?"
      - "Summarize the key features of Python 3.12"
      - "Research: advantages of AWQ vs GPTQ quantization"
    
    success_criteria:
      - Uses web_search tool appropriately
      - Synthesizes information from multiple sources
      - Provides factual, well-structured responses
      - Completes in under 30 seconds

  usage:
    import: "agents/templates/research-assistant.yaml"
    
  notes:
    - Requires web_search tool (Brave API or SearXNG)
    - Qwen handles factual queries well; use fallback for opinion/analysis
    - Best for: technology research, product comparisons, how-to guides
    - Not ideal for: real-time news (use direct browsing), deep academic research

# 🚀 Dream Server — Launch Readiness Checklist

*Status: Code Complete, Needs Distribution*

## What's Ready ✅

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `install.sh` | ✅ Ready | v2.0, hardware-aware, generates secrets |
| `docker-compose.yml` | ✅ Ready | All services, profile-based activation |
| `docs/QUICKSTART.md` | ✅ Ready | 10-minute install guide |
| `docs/HARDWARE-GUIDE.md` | ✅ Ready | Buy recommendations by tier |
| `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | ✅ Ready | Common issues + fixes |
| `SECURITY.md` | ✅ Ready | Best practices |
| `workflows/` | ✅ Ready | 4 n8n workflows included |
| `dream-cli` | ✅ Ready | CLI for status/logs/benchmark |

## What's Blocking Distribution

### 1. GitHub Access
- Repo: `Light-Heart-Labs/Lighthouse-AI` 
- **Status:** Likely private
- **Needed:** Make `dream-server/` directory accessible, or extract to separate repo

### 2. No Easy Install Path
Current flow requires:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/Lighthouse-AI.git
cd Lighthouse-AI/dream-server
./install.sh
```

Better flow would be:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/Lighthouse-AI/main/dream-server/install.sh | bash
```

### 3. No Landing Page
- No website explaining what it is
- No signup/interest capture
- No way for people to discover it

---

## Launch Options

### Option A: Soft Launch (Fastest)
1. Make repo public (or create separate `dream-server` repo)
2. Post in AI Discord servers / Reddit
3. Share with 1-3 trusted testers

### Option B: Product Hunt Launch
1. Create landing page
2. Record demo video
3. Schedule Product Hunt launch
4. Prepare for feedback volume

### Option C: Consulting Anchor
1. Use Dream Server as demo for consulting leads
2. "Here's what your setup could look like"
3. Offer installation as paid service

## One-Liner Pitch

> **Dream Server:** Buy hardware, run one command, have your own ChatGPT running locally in 10 minutes. Voice agents, RAG, workflows included.

## Expanded Pitch (for landing page)

### The Problem
Cloud AI costs scale with usage. You're paying per token, forever. And your data leaves your network.

### The Solution
Dream Server is a turnkey local AI stack. One installer detects your hardware, downloads the right models, and spins up:
- **Fast LLM inference** (vLLM with Qwen 32B)
- **Beautiful chat UI** (Open WebUI)
- **Voice input/output** (Whisper + Kokoro)
- **Workflow automation** (n8n)
- **Vector search** (Qdrant)

All running on YOUR hardware. No monthly fees. No data leaving your network.

### Who It's For
- Developers who want local AI without the setup pain
- Small businesses with privacy requirements
- AI enthusiasts who want to stop paying OpenAI
- Consultants building AI solutions for clients

### What You Need
- Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- NVIDIA GPU with 12GB+ VRAM
- 10 minutes

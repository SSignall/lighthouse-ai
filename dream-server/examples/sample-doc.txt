# Dream Server: Local AI Infrastructure

Dream Server is a turnkey local AI stack designed to bring powerful AI capabilities to your own hardware. It provides a complete solution for running large language models, voice processing, and workflow automation entirely on your own infrastructure.

## Core Components

### vLLM - High Performance Inference
vLLM serves as the backbone of Dream Server, providing OpenAI-compatible API endpoints for language model inference. It supports models like Qwen 2.5, Llama 3, and Mistral, automatically selecting the best model for your hardware tier.

### Open WebUI - Chat Interface
A beautiful, responsive chat interface that works with any OpenAI-compatible backend. Features include conversation history, model selection, and user management.

### Voice Processing
- **Whisper** for speech-to-text transcription with high accuracy
- **Piper** for natural-sounding text-to-speech synthesis
- Combined, these enable fully local voice assistants

### Workflow Automation
n8n integration provides visual workflow automation. Pre-built workflows include:
- Document Q&A (RAG pipeline)
- Voice transcription
- Code assistance
- Scheduled summarization

### Vector Database
Qdrant provides efficient vector storage and similarity search for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications.

## Hardware Tiers

Dream Server automatically detects your GPU and configures appropriate models:

1. **Minimal** (<20GB VRAM): 7B quantized models
2. **Entry** (20-27GB VRAM): 14B AWQ models
3. **Prosumer** (28-47GB VRAM): 32B AWQ models
4. **Pro** (48GB+ VRAM): 70B+ models

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/Lighthouse-AI.git
cd Lighthouse-AI/dream-server
./install.sh
```

The installer handles everything: Docker setup, GPU configuration, model selection, and service startup.

## Philosophy

Dream Server embodies the principle that AI should be accessible, private, and owned by users. Your data stays on your hardware. Your models run locally. Your AI, your rules.
